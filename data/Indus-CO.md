# Indus-CO Dataset

## Introduction

Indus-CO is a remote sensing image dataset constructed to support research on semi-supervised detection of industrial composite facilities in large-scale optical imagery.

---

## Data Source

- High-resolution optical imagery collected from **Google Earth (zoom level 17)**
- Candidate facility locations obtained using **Points of Interest (POI)** data
- Manual screening and verification performed to ensure data reliability and annotation quality

---

## Dataset Access

Due to the large data volume and usage constraints, the complete Indus-CO dataset is **not hosted directly on GitHub**.

### Indus-CO_examples

A lightweight example subset, **Indus-CO_examples**, is publicly available for download via **Google Drive**:

- This subset contains a limited number of representative samples from each facility category
- It is intended for illustrating data format, scene characteristics, and facilitating quick testing

### Full Dataset

The full Indus-CO dataset will be made available **after the official publication of the paper**.  
Researchers interested in accessing the complete dataset for academic purposes may contact the **corresponding author**.
